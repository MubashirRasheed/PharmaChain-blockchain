## Pharmaceutical Supply Chain and Procurement System



### Introduction
The Pharmaceutical Supply Chain and Procurement System is a revolutionary solution that leverages blockchain technology to ensure complete traceability, transparency, and authenticity in the pharmaceutical industry. This system is built using the Vite blockchain platform and consists of various components, including personalized dashboards with analytics, a bidding platform, real-time chat functionality, a user-friendly frontend digital pharmacy, and integration with Stripe for secure contracts.

### Features

- **Blockchain-Based Traceability**: Each medicine package is equipped with a unique QR code that contains extensive information about the medicine's manufacturing details, raw materials used, and its journey through the supply chain. The blockchain ensures the integrity and immutability of this information, providing stakeholders with complete transparency and traceability.

- **Expiry Date Verification**: The QR code scanning functionality allows users to instantly verify the expiry date of medicines by retrieving the information from the blockchain. This ensures the safety and effectiveness of the medications being purchased.

- **Personalized Dashboards with Analytics**: Stakeholders are provided with personalized dashboards that offer detailed analytics and insights into the pharmaceutical supply chain. These dashboards enable stakeholders to monitor key metrics, track performance, and make data-driven decisions.

- **Real-Time Chat Functionality**: The system includes a real-time chat feature that enables seamless communication among stakeholders, fostering collaboration and facilitating instant information exchange.

- **Bidding Platform**: The bidding platform streamlines the procurement process, allowing stakeholders to participate in competitive bidding for pharmaceutical products. This ensures fair pricing and optimal supply chain management.

- **User-Friendly Digital Pharmacy**: The frontend environment of the system includes a user-friendly digital pharmacy where authorized users can purchase medicines with confidence. The digital pharmacy provides a seamless and efficient experience for users, enhancing accessibility and convenience.

- **Integration with Stripe for Secure Contracts**: The system integrates with Stripe, a secure payment gateway, to facilitate secure contract transactions between stakeholders. This ensures a trusted and reliable process for financial transactions within the system.
